About me

My environmental journey started in Ottawa, where I completed a Bachelor’s in Environmental Science at Carleton University. I later moved to Vancouver and worked in environmental monitoring, gained hands on experience in fieldwork, data collection, and worked alongside a variety of multidisciplinary teams. I went on to complete a Data Science diploma at BrainStation and took additional courses at UBC, which helped shape my interest in how data can support meaningful decisions, in both the environmental spaces and beyond. In my spare time, I’m usually with my dog, binging TV shows or movies, painting or drawing, trying out new recipes in the kitchen, or enjoying some outdoor activities. I also enjoy traveling, gardening, exploring new breweries and wineries, or taking a stab at making my own! I joined MGEM to build on what I’ve learned so far and to explore better opportunities for myself while applying those skills in meaningful work. I’m excited to learn in a collaborative environment with people who are just as curious and committed to practical solutions.
